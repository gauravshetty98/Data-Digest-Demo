    "issue_description": "During peak pallet moves, the AMR intermittently triggers an emergency slow-down due to false-positive obstacle detections on the front LiDAR. This causes stop-and-go behavior, queueing in narrow aisles, and occasional mission aborts.\n\nLog review suggests the issue correlates with reflective shrink-wrap + low-angle scans; the filter thresholds in the current firmware appear too sensitive.",
